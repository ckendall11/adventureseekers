      <h3>Peak Bagging Challenge (Year-Round)</h3>
      <p>This ongoing challenge encourages you to conquer a set number of mountain peaks throughout the year. Participants can choose from various difficulty levels, with categories for elevation gain, number of peaks climbed, or a combination of both. Track your progress using the Adventure Seekers app or website, and share photos of your summits on social media using the hashtag #AdventureSeekersPeakBagging. Prizes will be awarded at the end of the year for participants who achieve the highest number of peaks in their chosen category.

    <h3>Community Cleanup Challenge (Monthly)</h3>
    <p>This monthly challenge promotes environmental stewardship and gives back to the natural places we love to explore. Participants can organize or join cleanup events in their local parks, trails, or beaches. Track your cleanup efforts by logging the number of bags of trash collected and submitting photos through the Adventure Seekers app. Each month, the community with the highest average cleanup participation per member will be recognized and awarded bonus points towards the annual Peak Bagging Challenge or a donation made in their community's name to a local environmental organization.
